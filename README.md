Whether you're managing configuration settings, language translations, or other data structures stored in YAML, the Vite YAML Plugin streamlines your development workflow, enabling faster iteration and smoother deployment. **Elevate your Vite projects today with the power of YAML integration.**

## Installation
To install the Vite YAML Plugin, you can use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @yaml-js/vite
or
yarn add -D @yaml-js/vite
```

## Usage
Integrate the Vite YAML Plugin into your Vite configuration as follows:

```javascript
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import yaml from '@yaml-js/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [yaml()],
});
```

Now, you can import and use YAML files in your project:

```javascript
import config from './config.yaml';

console.log(config);
```

## Typescript Projects
This package also includes the needed types to allow importing *.yaml/*.yml files on your typescript projects, for that please update your tsconfig.json file and add the types by adding '@yaml-js/types'

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["vite/client", "@yaml-js/types"]
  }
}
```
